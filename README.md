# Work-Day-Scheduler

In this assignment I attempted to create a Work Day Scheduler that would allow users to input tasks from thier schedule and save them to local storage for later reference. The project would also allow the user to view which tasks existed in the past, present, or future. 

While I was not able to get the project working, I did learn how to to successfully add dates to a page using moment.js and how to call, and reformat information using jquery (see the time function/logs).
